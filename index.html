						<!-- About -->
							<article id="about">
								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Family.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>First-Generation: During the '80s, my parents immigrated to the United States with literally nothing to their name. They just knew their vision of a brighter future was out there, and they would work as hard as necessary to bring it to life. Their journey to establish themselves was a tumoltuous and arduous one, but they remained optimistic. My father always said, "If you cannot find a door, find a window, or cut down the shrubs and pave a way." Then came six kids and all of the responsibilities and expenses that come with such a large family. Growing up we didn't have much luxuries or privileges, but I always said that we just had less distractions. I was able to focus on pushing existent boundaries and along with my siblings, we were the first in our family and extended family to graduate from High School and University.<p>
